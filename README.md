  I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at the University of Warwick in my second year. 
  
  CSIA - The point of this project was to help my aunt who had a 9 year old son. Since classes were online due to covid, my cousin couldn't have pracitce in basic operations of math and was all into videogames. Even after online eductation, videogames became a regular habit of his and so she asked me for help. To fix her problem she was trying to get him away from the computers. This solution was teporary and was not very effective.To fix this problem, she has asked me whether I can do anything about it and as seen by the transcript, when I proposed the idea of making a teaching game she loved it. To rest his eyes, I have given that chance to my client, as she is the one inputting questions and she can input as many or as little as she wants, where she can assume the time he will spend playing the game and make it healthy.
